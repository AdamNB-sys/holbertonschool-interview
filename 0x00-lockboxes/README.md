# 0x00 Lockboxes


**Algorithm**

You have `n` number of locked boxes. Each box is numbered sequentially 
from `0` to `n-1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

* Prototype: `def canUnlockAll(boxes)`
* `boxes` is a list of lists
* A key with the same number as a box opens that box
* You can assume all keys will be positive integers
    * There can be keys that do not have boxes
* The first box `boxes[0]` is unlocked
* Return `True` is all boxes can be opened, else return `False`
